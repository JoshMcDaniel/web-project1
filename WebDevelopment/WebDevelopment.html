				<h1>What is Web Development</h1>
				<p>
				Web development is the creation of webpages or websites. These webpages or websites are placed on the internet or even an intranet.
				This is typically done by a web developer that uses certain tools to structure, design and manipulate content on a webpage or website.
				Specifically, web development is the writing of code in multiple programming languages to create an appealing and functional website for a user.
				In today's advanced technological world, there are many different tools that a web developer can use to create a website.
				Also, there are different forms of web developers themselves. I will discuss these topics below.

				<h2>What is used to create a website?</h2>
					<p>
					While there are many tools available to a developer for creating a website, there are a few basics that are fundamental.
					Listed below are the most fundamental of all web development tools. These are the first stepping stones for any aspiring web developer.
					</p>
					<ul class="indent">
						<li>Hypertext Markup Language version 5 (HTML5)</li>
						<li>Cascading Style Sheet version 3 (CSS3)</li>
						<li>JavaScript</li>
					</ul>				
					<p>
					HTML5 is used to structure the content of a webpage. CSS3 is used to add style to the content and design the overall <em>feel</em> of the webpage.
					JavaScript is used to add interactivity to the webpage by use of prompts, alerts, events, functions and so on. 
					Together, these three technologies are called the <strong>Trifecta</strong> of web development. A modern web developer must learn and master 
					these basic technologies as a minimum to be competitive in the current web development industry.
