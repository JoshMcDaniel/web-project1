				<h2>JavaScript (JS)</h2>
				<p>
				JS is one of the most used programming languages in the world due to it's simplicity and functionality.
				It is a high-level programming language that is processed on the client-side which increases the speed of things like form validation.
				The combination of HTML, CSS and JS (the Trifecta) is the foundation of the World Wide Web. 
				JS is used to make a webpage interactive and perform many functions on the client-side which saves bandwidth and server processing time.

				<h2>JS Alert</h2>
					<p>
					One key feature of JS is it's ability to alert the user with a pop-up. 
					As long as JS is enabled, it can provide helpful messages to the user in real-time.
					It can also communicate with the users device in order to perform useful functions such as getting and displaying the current date. 
					Press the "Show Date" button to see JS alert a message with the current date. (JavaScript must be enabled)
					</p>
